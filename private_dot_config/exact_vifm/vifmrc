" --------------------------
" This is all based on the sample vifmrc that ships with vifm
" http://vifm.sourceforge.net/

" This is the actual command used to start vi.  The default is vim.
" If you would like to use another vi clone such as Elvis or Vile
" you will need to change this setting.
set vicmd=vim
if executable('nvim')
  set vicmd=nvim
elseif $EDITOR != ''
  echo 'Note: using `'.$EDITOR.'` as an editor'
  let &vicmd = $EDITOR
endif

" Trash Directory
" The default is to move files that are deleted with dd or :d to
" the trash directory.  If you change this you will not be able to move
" files by deleting them and then using p to put the file in the new location.
" I recommend not changing this until you are familiar with vifm.
" This probably shouldn't be an option.
set trash
set trashdir="~/Trash"

" This is how many directories to store in the directory history.
set history=100

" Follow links on l or Enter.
set nofollowlinks

" With this option turned on you can run partially entered commands with
" unambiguous beginning using :! (e.g. :!Te instead of :!Terminal or :!Te<tab>).
set fastrun

" Natural sort of (version) numbers within text.
set sortnumbers

" show numbers before each file
set number

" Maximum number of changes that can be undone.
set undolevels=100

" If you installed the vim.txt help file set vimhelp.
" If would rather use a plain text help file set novimhelp.
set novimhelp

" If you would like to run an executable file when you
" press return on the file name set this.
set norunexec

" Use KiB, MiB, ... instead of KB, MB, ...
set noiec

" use syscalls, which enables progress tracking for big file operations
set syscalls

" Selected color scheme
" https://github.com/jubalh/vifm-colors
colorscheme nord

" The FUSE_HOME directory will be used as a root dir for all FUSE mounts.
" Unless it exists with write/exec permissions set, vifm will attempt to
" create it.
" Have a look at FUSE for OSX https://osxfuse.github.io/
set fusehome=/tmp/vifm_FUSE

" Format for displaying time in file list. For example:
" TIME_STAMP_FORMAT=%m/%d-%H:%M
" See man date or man strftime for details.
set timefmt=%d/%m/%Y\ %H:%M

" Show list of matches on tab completion in command-line mode
set wildmenu

" Ignore case in search patterns unless it contains at least one uppercase
" letter
set ignorecase
set smartcase

" Don't highlight search results automatically
set nohlsearch

" Use increment searching (search while typing)
set incsearch

" Try to leave some space from cursor to upper/lower border in lists
set scrolloff=4

" Don't do too many requests to slow file systems
set slowfs=curlftpfs

" Set custom status line look
set statusline="  %t%= %A %10u:%-7g %15s %20d  "

" Set ruler format
set rulerformat="%=%2l-%S"

" What should be saved automatically between vifm runs
" Like in previous versions of vifm
" set vifminfo=options,filetypes,commands,bookmarks,dhistory,state,cs
" Like in vi
set vifminfo=dhistory,savedirs,chistory,state,shistory,
    \phistory,fhistory,dirstack,registers,bookmarks

" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

" Examples of configuring both panels

" Customize view columns a bit (enable ellipsis for truncated file names)
"
" windo set viewcolumns=-{name}..,6{}.

" Set relative numbering for 2nd pane
" windo set relativenumber

" Filter-out build and temporary files
"
" windo filter! /^.*\.(lo|o|d|class|py[co])$|.*~$/

" Various customization examples

" Use ag (the silver searcher) instead of grep
"
" set grepprg=ag\ --line-numbers\ %i\ %a\ %s

" Add additional place to look for executables
