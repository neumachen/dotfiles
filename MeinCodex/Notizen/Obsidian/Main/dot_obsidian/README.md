# Obsidian Vault — Configuration Reference

This directory (`dot_obsidian/`) is the Obsidian configuration source managed by
Chezmoi. It is symlinked to `.obsidian/` at the vault root on the host machine
after `chezmoi apply`. Do not rename or restructure this directory.

Vault content (notes, attachments, etc.) lives at the host vault path and is not
tracked here. Only configuration is tracked: plugin settings, hotkeys, appearance,
snippets, and templates.

## Vault Structure

```
<vault-root>/
├── akten/          project folders, filed by creation month under YYYY/MM/
│   └── YYYY/MM/<uuid6>-<slug>/index.md
│                   (folder uses 6-hex-char UUID prefix; full UUID in frontmatter `id`)
│                   (see "Akten Project Folders" below)
├── assets/         attachments (images, PDFs, files)
├── kadai/          task notes — file-per-task with `task:` frontmatter, filed by creation date
│   └── YYYY/MM/DD/ created on demand by the new-task template
├── templates/      Templater templates (also tracked by Chezmoi)
├── zakki/          general notes — filed by creation date under YYYY/MM/DD/, categorized by tags
│   └── YYYY/MM/DD/ created on demand by the new-zakki template
└── .obsidian/      ← this directory (dot_obsidian in Chezmoi)
```

Zakki organization is **date-based on disk** and **tag-based by category**. When a Zakki is
later consolidated into an Akten (record), its tag becomes the Akten's record category.

## Note Identity

Every note carries a standard frontmatter block:

```yaml
---
id:               <full-uuidv4-hex>             — 32-char hex UUIDv4 (no hyphens), set at creation
path:             <vault-relative file path including .md>
filename:         <bare filename stem, without .md>   — first 6 hex chars of `id` for
                                                       zakki / vermerk / kadai; `index`
                                                       for Akten (folder uses the 6-hex
                                                       prefix instead)
title:            human-readable title
type:             akten | vermerk | zakki | kadai   — document kind, set by template
aliases:
tags:                                            — `<type>` (akten / vermerk / zakki) auto-added;
                                                   `task` for kadai (Tasks plugin filter);
                                                   Vermerke also tag the parent Akte's UUID
                                                   for `#<akte-uuid>` cross-doc search;
                                                   user-added tags accumulate alongside
created_at.utc:   "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ"        — set at creation, never updated
created_at.local: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:MM"   — local wall-clock + offset at creation
modified_at.utc:  "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ"        — auto-maintained by Linter on every save
modified_at.local:"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:MM"   — set at creation; not refreshed on save (see below)
---
```

### Document ID

Every note's `id` is a full 32-char hex UUIDv4 (hyphens stripped), generated
via `crypto.randomUUID()` at creation. Identical schema across types:

| Type | `id` | Filename / folder prefix | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `akten` | full UUID | first 6 hex chars + `-<slug>` (folder name) | folder `f47ac1-q3-tax-review/index.md`, `id: f47ac10b58cc4372a5670e02b2c3d479` |
| `vermerk` | full UUID | first 6 hex chars + `-<slug>` (filename) | `f47ac1-named-pipe-browser-forwarding.md`, `id: f47ac10b58cc4372a5670e02b2c3d479` |
| `zakki` | full UUID | first 6 hex chars + `-<slug>` (filename) | `9c2a8d-coffee-shop-thoughts.md`, `id: 9c2a8d11ef4a4b9aa2cb35bf12d8e0c5` |
| `kadai` | full UUID | first 6 hex chars + `-<slug>` (filename) | `3b1d6f-fix-failing-build.md`, `id: 3b1d6f7e88d9498aa6c2d5fe04a91e7c` |

Why short filenames: 32-char folder/filenames are noisy in the file
explorer and tab bar; the 6-hex prefix is enough for collision-free
naming inside a single date folder (16M-space, dozens of notes per day
worst case). The full UUID stays in frontmatter `id` as the canonical
identifier — anything that needs to disambiguate beyond the filename
reads `id` directly.

Vermerk, Zakki, Kadai, and Akten all append a sanitized title slug
after the 6-hex prefix (`<uid6>-<slug>`) so the file explorer is
readable. Slug sanitization is identical across types: NFD-fold to
ASCII, lowercase, non-`[a-z0-9]` runs collapsed to `-`, trimmed,
truncated to 60 chars on a `-` boundary, falls back to `untitled` if
empty. Akten encode the slug in the folder name (the `index.md` itself
keeps its bare `index` filename); the other three encode it in the
file basename.

The `type:` field is the source of truth for document kind. Time
ordering for Zakki / Kadai comes from the `YYYY/MM/DD/` parent folder
plus `created_at.utc`; the random UUID filename is unsortable and that's
fine.

The `path` field carries the document's full vault-relative path (with `.md`),
so a note's canonical location can be read straight from frontmatter without
walking the filesystem. The `filename` field is the bare stem (no `.md`):
`index` for Akten, `<uid6>-<slug>` for Vermerk / Zakki / Kadai. Both fields
stay in sync with the file's actual location via
`templates/sync-system-frontmatter.md`, a Templater startup hook that
installs **two** vault-wide listeners:

1. **`vault.on("rename", ...)`** — when a file is renamed/moved (by the
   user, by Obsidian's link-update side effects, or by listener #2),
   rewrite that file's `path:` and `filename:` frontmatter via
   `app.fileManager.processFrontMatter`.
2. **`metadataCache.on("changed", ...)`** — when the `title:`
   frontmatter of a managed note (Vermerk under `akten/.../vermerke/`,
   Kadai under `kadai/YYYY/MM/DD/`, Zakki under `zakki/YYYY/MM/DD/`)
   changes, recompute `<uid6>-<slug>` from the new title and rename
   the file via `app.fileManager.renameFile`. The first metadata-changed
   event per file is treated as the indexing pass and skipped, so
   pre-existing legacy files are NOT mass-renamed at startup — bulk
   migration goes through the one-off scripts in
   `~/MeinCodex/Codekiste/obsidian/scripts/one-off/`.

Obsidian's built-in `alwaysUpdateLinks` setting rewrites wikilink
targets in tandem with the rename, so the link graph and per-note
frontmatter both follow. Caveat: only in-Obsidian renames fire the
events — renames done outside Obsidian (e.g., via shell) leave both
wikilinks and frontmatter stale.

Timestamp keys use flat dotted names (`created_at.utc`, `modified_at.local`, …) — same
reason as the `task.*` fields: Obsidian's Properties UI flattens nested YAML objects into
JSON strings, so dotted keys render as separate rows. **Linter only refreshes
`modified_at.utc`** on save (it natively supports a single key per concept). `*.local`
fields stay at their creation-time value; treat them as a "born-at" record, not a "last
edited" indicator. If you need fresh local-time tracking on save, that requires a custom
plugin — out of scope here.

Task notes additionally carry flat dotted-key fields in the same frontmatter block —
`task.task_id`, `task.start-date`, `task.due-date`, `task.priority`, `task.status`,
`task.icon`, `task.meta.attr`. Each one renders as its own row in Properties (Number for
priority, Date & time for the dates, Text for the rest), and Bases reads them as ordinary
string-keyed fields. See REFERENCE.md for the full task schema.

## Templates

Located at `<vault-root>/templates/`. All templates use Templater syntax.

| File | Hotkey | Command label (via Commander) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `neuer-zakki.md` | `Cmd+N` | — | General note — prompts for title, lands in `zakki/YYYY/MM/DD/<uuid6>-<slug>.md` with tags `[zakki]`. Frontmatter `id` is the full 32-char UUID; filename uses the 6-hex prefix plus a sanitized title slug (slug rules identical to `neuer-akten.md`). |
| `neuer-akten.md` | — | `Akten: Neue Akte` | Project folder — prompts for title, creates `akten/YYYY/MM/<uuid6>-<slug>/index.md` with tags `[akten]`. Folder name uses the first 6 hex chars of the UUID; the full 32-char UUID lives in frontmatter `id`. |
| `neuer-vermerk.md` | — | `Akten: Neuer Vermerk` | Memo inside an Akte — runs in **insert mode** (matches `shinki-kadai`'s pattern). Auto-detects the parent Akte from the active file's enclosing folder; falls back to a suggester listing all Akten if none is active. Mode picker (`Title only` vs `Full document`) controls whether focus switches to the new Vermerk after creation. Lands in `akten/YYYY/MM/<akte-folder>/vermerke/<uuid6>-<slug>.md` (the `vermerke/` subdirectory is created on first use; slug sanitization mirrors `neuer-akten.md`) with tags `[vermerk, <parent-akte-uuid6>]` plus property `reference.akten.id: <parent-akte-uuid>` (full parent UUID). The Vermerk's own UUID lives in `id` only — there's no separate `vermerk.id` field anymore. **Always inserts a wikilink to the new Vermerk into the parent Akte's `index.md`** under a `## Vermerke` section (created on first use, reused thereafter), regardless of which document is currently active. |
| `shinki-kadai.md` | `Cmd+Shift+T` | `Kadai: Shinki Kadai (新規課題)` | Task note — runs in **insert mode** by default (the hotkey is bound to `templater-obsidian:templates/shinki-kadai.md`), so the active document stays open and a wikilink to the new task is dropped into it. Two creation modes: `Title only` (just title prompt) and `Full document` (also prompts an optional description, then opens the new task after the link is inserted — priority and due date can be edited later in the task file or via the Tasks plugin). Where the link goes depends on Vim mode: in **insert mode**, the link is inserted at the cursor; in **normal mode**, the link is appended under a `## Inserted Tasks` section at the end of the active document (created on first use, reused on subsequent inserts). The task file itself always lives at `kadai/YYYY/MM/DD/<uuid6>-<slug>.md` (slug rules match `neuer-akten.md`). The task body's `## Status` section embeds two `meta-bind` widgets: an `INPUT[inlineSelect(...):task.status]` dropdown constrained to the 6 canonical options (`incipient`, `in-progress`, `completed`, `discarded`, `blocked`, `abandoned`) and a derived `VIEW` field rendering `☑ Done` / `☐ Not done` based on whether `task.status` is `completed` or `discarded`. Status defaults to `incipient` at creation; change it via the dropdown. **Context-aware label and references:** the mode picker's placeholder reflects the active document context — `Add to new Akten` (active = Akte index), `Add to new Vermerk` (active = Vermerk), `Add to new Zakki` (active = Zakki), or `Task creation` (no context). Reference fields follow the label: Akten → `reference.akten.id`; Vermerk → both `reference.vermerk.id` and `reference.akten.id` (parent); Zakki → `reference.zakki.id`; no context → no reference fields. **Standalone fallback:** invoking `Templater: Create new note from template → templates/shinki-kadai.md` (or any create-mode wrapper) skips the insert path entirely and creates the task as a standalone open file — same prompts, no reference fields, no link insertion. |
| `add-tag.md` | `Cmd+Alt+T` | — | Adds a tag to the current note's frontmatter. First shows a suggester populated from `app.metadataCache.getTags()` so existing tags fuzzy-autocomplete as you type; press `Esc` on the suggester to fall through to a free-form prompt for a brand-new tag. |
| `sync-system-frontmatter.md` | — (startup template) | — | Registered in Templater's `startup_templates`. Runs once on vault open to install **two** vault-wide listeners: (1) `app.vault.on("rename", ...)` — keeps each note's `path:` / `filename:` frontmatter aligned with its current location after any rename or move; (2) `app.metadataCache.on("changed", ...)` — when `title:` changes on a managed note (Vermerk / Kadai / Zakki), recomputes `<uid6>-<slug>` and renames the file via `app.fileManager.renameFile`, which then triggers Obsidian's `alwaysUpdateLinks` to rewrite wikilinks vault-wide. The first metadata-changed event per file is treated as the indexing pass and skipped, so legacy bare-`<uid6>.md` files are NOT mass-renamed silently at startup. Idempotent across plugin reloads via `globalThis` guards + `app.vault.offref()` / `app.metadataCache.offref()`. Produces no file output. |

To pick any template interactively (including `neuer-akten`), use `Cmd+Shift+N`
(Templater → *Create new note from template*). To insert a template into the
current note, use `Cmd+Shift+I`.

### Custom command labels (Commander plugin)

The "Command label" column above lists names surfaced via the **Commander** plugin
(community plugin, install via Settings → Community plugins → search "Commander").
Commander exposes single-step macros that re-trigger an underlying command under a
custom palette label. They live in `dot_obsidian/plugins/cmdr/data.json` under the
`macros` array and are configured directly in source (no UI step needed):

| Macro name (palette label) | Underlying command ID |
|---|---|
| `Akten: Neue Akte` | `templater-obsidian:create-templates/neuer-akten.md` |
| `Akten: Neuer Vermerk` | `templater-obsidian:templates/neuer-vermerk.md` |
| `Kadai: Shinki Kadai (新規課題)` | `templater-obsidian:create-templates/shinki-kadai.md` |

Note: Obsidian prefixes plugin commands with the plugin name in the palette, so
the macros appear as `Commander: Akten: Neue Akte`, etc. — searching by `Akten`
or `Kadai` still surfaces them cleanly. The `Commander:` prefix is unavoidable
without writing a custom plugin.

## Akten Project Folders

Each project under `akten/` is a folder containing `index.md`, never a flat note.
Projects are filed by creation month under `YYYY/MM/` (one fewer level of nesting
than `zakki/` and `kadai/` because Akten are coarser-grained — at most a handful
per month rather than many per day). Creation/update timestamps live only in the
`index.md` frontmatter — not in the directory name.

Path format:

    akten/YYYY/MM/<uuid6>-<title-slug>/index.md

- `YYYY/MM` — local creation year/month, zero-padded.
- `<uuid6>` — first 6 hex chars of the full UUIDv4 stored in `id`
  (e.g. `f47ac1` from `f47ac10b58cc4372a5670e02b2c3d479`). Short enough
  to keep folder names readable; full UUID in frontmatter for canonical
  identity. Random, not sortable; ordering by creation time isn't
  needed since the `YYYY/MM/` path already groups by month.
- `<title-slug>` — title NFD-folded to ASCII, lowercased, non-`[a-z0-9]` → `-`,
  runs collapsed, trimmed, truncated to 60 chars on a `-` boundary; falls back
  to `untitled` if empty.

`index.md` carries the standard note frontmatter (`id`, `title`, `aliases`,
empty `tags:`, `created_at.{utc,local}`, `modified_at.{utc,local}`). Add
subfolders or attachments inside the project folder freely; the project's
identity is the folder name and its canonical entry point is `index.md`.
Vermerke created via `Akten: Neuer Vermerk` land in a `vermerke/`
subdirectory next to `index.md` (auto-created on first use) as
`<id>.md`, and a wikilink is appended to the index under a `## Vermerke`
section.

Examples:
- `akten/2026/05/f47ac1-q3-tax-review-fy26/index.md`
- `akten/2026/05/9c2a8d-migration-postgres-aurora/index.md`
- `akten/2026/05/3b1d6f-arger-mit-dem-vermieter/index.md`

## Daily Journal (deferred)

There is no dedicated daily journal yet. For now, daily entries are effectively
derived from Zakki — filtering by date folder or by `created` frontmatter is the
intended way to read "the journal for a given day". The Daily Notes core plugin
is therefore disabled.

Eventually a dedicated daily journal directory will be added, following the same
date-folder + sortable-ID convention as Zakki. Its directory name will be German
(TBD), to match the naming style of `Notizen`/`Akten`/`Zakki`.
